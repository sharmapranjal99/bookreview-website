                    Set in the underground Fae realm of Mistei, Servant of Earth follows Kenna Heron, a resilient and fiercely independent human woman. Known in her village for her untamed spirit, Kenna is captured and thrust into servitude in the cruel Fae court. Her life takes a dangerous turn when she becomes the servant to a Fae noblewoman tasked with completing six grueling trials, each representing a branch of elemental magic: Fire, Earth, Light, Void, Illusion, and Blood. Success in these trials would grant her mistress immortality and the title of heir to Earth House, but failure means death for both of them.
                    
                    Kennaâ€™s sole ally in this treacherous world is a sentient dagger of mysterious origin. As she faces monstrous creatures, deadly magic, and the sadistic whims of the Fae king, Kenna uncovers a burgeoning rebellion within the kingdom. Her involvement deepens when she forms a connection with the charismatic leader of the uprising, igniting a forbidden romance that forces her to confront her own desires and principles.
                    
                    As Kenna navigates the perilous trials, she finds herself not only battling for survival but also questioning the oppressive hierarchy of the Fae world. Her journey becomes a fight for justice and freedom, where courage, cunning, and determination are her only weapons against a seemingly invincible foe.
                    
                    The story blends high-stakes fantasy with emotional depth, exploring themes of resilience, sacrifice, and the desire for a better world. With its richly imagined setting, complex characters, and unexpected twists, Servant of Earth is a gripping tale of empowerment and rebellion that sets the stage for future installments in the Shards of Magic series.</p>
