                    My Inventions is Nikola Tesla’s autobiography, where he recounts his life, ideas, and achievements. Divided into six parts, it provides insights into his childhood, education, and groundbreaking work in science and technology.
                    
                    Tesla begins by describing his early years in Croatia, highlighting his vivid imagination, creativity, and love for inventing. He shares anecdotes about his childhood, including his ability to visualize concepts in his mind, which became instrumental in his inventive process.
                    
                    In the following sections, Tesla delves into his career, emphasizing his revolutionary contributions to alternating current (AC) electricity, wireless energy, and other innovations. He reflects on his struggles, financial challenges, and conflicts with contemporaries like Thomas Edison. Tesla's ability to foresee future technologies, such as wireless communication and robotics, showcases his extraordinary vision.
                    
                    Tesla also discusses his unique work habits, such as working tirelessly and avoiding distractions, and reveals his eccentricities, including his sensitivity to light and sound. He credits his remarkable memory and problem-solving skills to his disciplined lifestyle.
                    
                    The book concludes with Tesla’s philosophical musings on the role of science and his vision of harnessing natural forces to improve humanity. My Inventions remains a compelling testament to Tesla's genius and his enduring impact on modern technology.</p>
