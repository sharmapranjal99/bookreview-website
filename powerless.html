                <p class="book-description1">Powerless is a part of the Supers of Noble's Green collection.Superheroes soar in this promising debut—and they are kids!
                Powerless is the first installment in an enthralling fantasy series that combines elements of dark intrigue, emotional complexity, and a deeply immersive world. The novel follows Paedyn Gray, a cunning and resourceful protagonist who must navigate a dangerous kingdom where magic rules, and those without it are deemed “Powerless.” In this world, society is divided into those who wield magic, known as the Affinites, and those who do not. The Affinites are granted immense power and privilege, while the powerless are oppressed and treated as second-class citizens.

                Paedyn, however, is not an ordinary powerless individual. While she appears to lack magical abilities, she harbors a deadly secret—she has spent her life pretending to be powerless to avoid detection. Her extraordinary ability to sense and manipulate emotions is a rare and forbidden Affinity that she hides at all costs. The story unfolds as Paedyn is thrust into the heart of the magical court, a place teeming with danger, political intrigue, and power-hungry elites who would exploit her if her secret were discovered.

                The narrative takes a turn when Paedyn is coerced into entering the Affinites Academy, a brutal institution where magic-users are trained and tested. She must navigate its treacherous halls while maintaining her facade of powerlessness. The Academy is a microcosm of the larger societal conflicts, with rivalries, alliances, and deadly competitions shaping the lives of its students.

                Paedyn's journey is marked by her fierce independence and sharp wit, but she also grapples with feelings of isolation and mistrust. Her interactions with fellow students and teachers reveal the complexity of her character. Among the Academy's students, she encounters Caspian, a prince with a magnetic charm and a dangerous edge. Their relationship is fraught with tension, suspicion, and an undeniable attraction that threatens to unravel Paedyn's carefully constructed lies.

                As the stakes rise, Paedyn is drawn into a larger conspiracy that threatens the kingdom. Secrets about the origin of magic and the true nature of her Affinity are unveiled, challenging her perception of herself and her place in the world. Paedyn's struggle is not just against external enemies but also against her own fears and vulnerabilities.

                Powerless is a story of resilience, identity, and rebellion against an unjust system. Lauren Roberts weaves a tale that explores themes of power, privilege, and the lengths one will go to protect their true self. The richly imagined world, filled with dark magic and intricate politics, serves as a backdrop to Paedyn's journey of self-discovery and defiance. The novel ends on a suspenseful note, setting the stage for future revelations and battles in the series.

                Robert's debut is a gripping and emotionally charged fantasy that appeals to fans of morally gray characters, slow-burn romance, and high-stakes adventure. Paedyn Gray's journey from hiding in the shadows to confronting her destiny captivates readers and leaves them eager for the next chapter in this compelling saga.</p>
